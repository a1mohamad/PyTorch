    "# Applying the Transformer - Introduction to GPT-2 (Chapter 16 Application) 🤖\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook transitions from manually building the self-attention mechanism (covered in the previous file) to the practical application of a **state-of-the-art, large-scale Transformer model**: **GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2)**. It showcases how industry tools simplify the use of models built upon the concepts of **Chapter 16: Transformers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Leveraging the Hugging Face `transformers` Library 📦\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook primarily uses the highly popular **Hugging Face `transformers`** library, which abstracts away the complexity of managing gigabytes of model weights and configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **High-Level `pipeline`:** The fastest way to run the model is demonstrated using the `pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')` function. This single function handles tokenization, forward pass, sampling, and decoding the output text.\n",
    "* **Reproducibility:** The use of `set_seed(42)` ensures that the generated text output is consistent across runs, a best practice for demonstrating model behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The GPT-2 Architecture and Causal Attention 🧠\n",
    "\n",
    "This section provides insight into the specific Transformer variant being used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Decoder-Only Model:** GPT-2 is an **Autoregressive Language Model** built solely on the **Transformer Decoder** architecture. \n",
    "* **Causal Masking:** The notebook implicitly uses **Causal Self-Attention** (or **Masked Self-Attention**). This crucial mechanism ensures that when calculating the attention for a word, the model **only looks at words that came before it** in the sequence, preventing information leakage from the future and making sequential generation possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Practical Application: Text Generation ✍️\n",
    "\n",
    "The main demonstration of the notebook is showing the model's ability to generate coherent, novel text:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Seed Text (Prompt):** A short initial prompt (\"Hello readers! today is my anniversary, so I wanted to share some of the awesome stuff I have discovered along the way.\") is given to the model.\n",
    "* **Sampling:** The model continues the text, using the probabilities output by its final layer to **sample** the next token repeatedly until a stopping condition (like maximum length) is met. This showcases the generative power derived from the attention mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Component-Level Inspection\n",
    "\n",
    "For users who want to fine-tune or inspect the model more deeply, the notebook shows how to access the individual components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tokenizer (`GPT2Tokenizer`):** Demonstrates loading the specific GPT-2 tokenizer and encoding a text sequence into numerical IDs.\n",
    "* **Model (`GPT2Model`):** Shows loading the raw model object.\n",
    "* **Output Hidden State:** By running the model with encoded input, the notebook inspects the output shape (e.g., `torch.Size([1, 5, 768])`). This confirms that for every input token, the Transformer produces a contextualized **hidden state vector** (of dimension 768), which summarizes that token's meaning based on its relationship with all other preceding tokens in the sequence."
